types
contexts

contextual elements:
    - 'the source code'
    - 'the grammar'
    - 'the size'
    - 'the first object'
=> a form of contextual typing? local functions know what 'the source code' is. 
definite article vs indefinite (class); i.e., it is a dog (class), vs it is the dog (identity)


absence type -> (absent Tree; absent Integer;) effectively typed nulls - classic null eq to absent Object
absent type always allowed where regular type is
default value of declaration is absence of type.
